# Aracardexpansion
A Card expansion for Part 1 of Inscryption made by me,
Requires Sigilfix and CardApi to work

# Solved Bugs:
--Evolve Cards are broken-- ( this will probably be fixed in the next few days )

Black Square Sigils ( not something i can change currently, look below for what each black square sigil card does)

# Update Notes:

Another Update! Tons of Balance and Card change

# How to add to the Game
Step 1:
Install API, it is a dependency

Step 2:
Pu the Artwork folder and .dll file into the plugins folder

Step 3:
You are done
