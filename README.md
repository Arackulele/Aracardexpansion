A Card expansion for Part 1 of Inscryption made by me,
Requires JsonLoader and CardApi to work

Known issues:
Black Square Sigils ( not something i can change currently, look below for what each black square sigil card does)

How to add to the Game
Step 1:
Install API, it is a dependency

Step 2:
Pu tthe Artwork folder and .dll file into the plugins folder

Step 3:
You are done

Black Square Cards sigils :

Blobfish
-Moves after the owners turn ends and leaves a squirrel in its former place

Crow
-Reshuffels your hand when places , gives as many cards as currently in your hand

Corpsewalker
-Makes Cards die twice, giving double Bones and making some sigils activate twice

Reanimator
-Moves after the owners turn and leaves a Skeleton ( defined as 1 / 1 with brittle ) in its former place
