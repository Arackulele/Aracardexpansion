A Card expansion for Part 1 of Inscryption made by me,
Requires JsonLoader and CardApi to work

This is a very early Version , a lot of Cards drop rates and places found might not work correctly

Known issues:
Blurry Images ( not something i can change currently)

How to add to the Game
Step 1:
Install JsonLoader and CardApi and follow their install instructions

Step 2:
Put the Cards and Artworks Folders in the JsonLoader Folder

Step 3:
You are done
