# Aracardexpansion
A Card expansion for Part 1 of Inscryption made by me that adds Cards that fit the general Game theme while feeling unique enough to provide a fun new gameplay experience
Requires CardApi to work , SigilArtPatch is useful to install

--It is recommended to enable Mox, energy and Drone in the api Mods config to play with this Mod.--

# Known Issues:

Currently, there are no known issues!

# Update Notes:

Giant Balance Update
-A lot of Balance
-About 4 new Cards
-3 new Sigil ( technically 8 but 6 are because the God totems are changed)
-New Art

# How to add to the Game
Step 1:
Install API, it is a dependency

Step 2:
Put the Artwork folder and .dll file into the plugins folder

Step 3:
You are done
